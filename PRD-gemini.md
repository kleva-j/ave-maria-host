## 2. üí° Problem Statement and Target Audience

### 2.1 Problem Statement
Many small-scale traders, artisans, and daily wage earners struggle with the discipline of saving large lump sums and often rely on informal, unregulated, and sometimes insecure traditional daily contribution collectors (**DCCs**), leading to risk of fraud and lack of financial data to access formal credit.

### 2.2 Target Audience (User Persona)

| Persona Name | Background/Needs | Pain Points |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Adaeze, The Trader** | Age 35, runs a small stall in the market. Earns daily cash income. Needs to save a fixed amount (e.g., \$10) daily to accumulate capital for restocking every month. | Lack of physical security for cash; inconsistent DCC collection; no interest earned; no digital record of savings history. |
| **Bello, The Artisan** | Age 45, a skilled technician who gets paid upon project completion. Needs a structured way to contribute to a rotating group savings scheme (Ajo/Esusu) to get a lump sum for a major purchase (e.g., new equipment). | Difficulty organizing and trusting group members; manual collection is inefficient; high commission fees in the informal system. |
