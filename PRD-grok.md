# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for AV-Daily

## Document Information

- **Product Name**: AV-Daily
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: October 21, 2025
- **Author**: Grok 4 (xAI)
- **Status**: Draft
- **Revision History**: Initial version generated based on standard PRD templates and best practices for mobile finance applications.

## 1. Product Overview

AV-Daily is a mobile application designed to help users build consistent saving habits through daily contributions. The app enables users to set personalized daily savings goals, automate small contributions from linked bank accounts, track progress toward financial targets, and receive motivational insights and rewards. It addresses the challenge of inconsistent saving by making contributions effortless and engaging, similar to habit-building apps but focused on personal finance.

### Product Vision

For individuals seeking to improve their financial health through small, consistent actions, AV-Daily is a mobile savings app that turns daily contributions into meaningful savings growth, unlike traditional banking apps that lack habit-forming features, by providing automated transfers, progress tracking, and gamified rewards to encourage long-term adherence.

### Product Purpose

The primary purpose is to empower users to save money daily without friction, fostering financial discipline and helping achieve goals like emergency funds, vacations, or debt reduction. It solves problems such as forgetting to save, lack of motivation, and difficulty tracking small contributions.

### Product Scope

- **In Scope**: User registration, daily contribution setup, bank integration for automated transfers, progress dashboards, goal setting, basic analytics, notifications, and simple rewards system.
- **Out of Scope (for MVP)**: Advanced investment options (e.g., stock purchases), cryptocurrency integration, multi-user family accounts, or physical card issuance.

### Target Audience

- Primary users: Adults aged 18-45, including young professionals, students, and families, who have basic banking access but struggle with consistent saving.
- Secondary users: Freelancers or gig workers with irregular income looking for flexible contribution options.

### Key Stakeholders

- Product Manager: Oversees development and alignment with goals.
- Development Team: Builds the app.
- Users: Provide feedback via beta testing.
- Partners: Banks or payment processors (e.g., Plaid for integrations).
- Marketing Team: Handles user acquisition.

## 2. Background and Challenges

Personal finance management often fails due to inconsistent habits, with many users abandoning savings goals after initial enthusiasm. Traditional savings accounts require manual transfers, leading to forgetfulness, while apps like Acorns focus on round-ups but may not emphasize daily routines. AV-Daily addresses:

- Lack of daily engagement in saving.
- Difficulty visualizing progress from small contributions.
- Low motivation without rewards or reminders.
- Security concerns with financial data.

Market signals indicate growing demand for micro-saving apps amid economic uncertainty, with competitors like Qapital or Digit offering similar features but room for innovation in gamification and simplicity.
